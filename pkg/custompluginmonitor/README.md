# Custom Plugin Monitor

Custom plugin monitor is a plugin mechanism for node-problem-detector. It will 
extend node-problem-detector to execute any monitor scripts written in any language. 
The monitor scripts must conform to the plugin protocol in exit code and standard 
output. For more info about the plugin protocol, please refer to the
[node-problem-detector plugin interface proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jK_5YloSYtboj-DtfjmYKxfNnUxCAvohLnsH5aGCAYQ/edit#)
